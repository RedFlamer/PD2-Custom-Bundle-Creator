You must ensure the game's bundle_db.blb is in the same directory as the tool for it to work as well as the bundle files you're appending to.
Make sure the bundle_db and bundles you're modifying are backed up as this tool will not create backups and does not provide a method to revert changes.
This tool was made for PAYDAY 2 update 24.2 and may have issues with other PD2 updates/PD:TH/RAID WW2.
